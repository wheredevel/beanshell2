#dowload links

Google-Code switched off their integrated download management, i.e. only old versions of Beanshell2 may be downloaded from [the old place](http://code.google.com/p/beanshell2/downloads).

So for now we offer download links here until we decide to which code hosting platform we migrate (the most obvious choice will be Github).
