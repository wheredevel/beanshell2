# Code Update Policy #

Please create an issue (on the Issues tab) before changing code.  When committing code, refer to the issue in the comment.  If the issue is a bug (defect), you can fix it right away.  If the issue is an enhancement, please wait 24 hours for comments.  If no one objects, then you can implement the enhancement.

This page is intentionally a wiki page.  We can discuss this update policy and change this page accordingly.

We will give out subversion commit privileges very freely.  We encourage everyone to contribute.
